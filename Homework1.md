Maths Introduction

Some modular arithmetic

1\. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

What is

a\) 4 + 4

1

b\) 3 x 5

1

c\) what is the inverse of 3 ?

5

2\. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

Can we consider \'S\' and the operation \'+\' to be a group ?

Yes

1\. Closure

For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G

2\. Associativity

For all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c)

3\. Identity element

There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the
equation e • a = a • e =

a holds. Such an element is unique and thus one speaks of the identity
element.

That element is 0

4\. Inverse element

For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted a

−1

(or −a, if the operation

is denoted \"+\"), such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity
element.

That element is 7 - a

3\. What is

-13 mod 5 ?

2

4\. Polynomials

For the polynomial x^3\ ^− x^2\ ^+ 4x − 12

Find a the positive root ?

x=2

What is the degree of this polynomial ?

Use cases

In your teams discuss any systems you have used that involved zero
knowledge proofs.

Have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with
a blockchain ?

As user, zcash, dark forest, zksync in testnet

What is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology ?

Privacy preserve.

Think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs that you would like to
see developed.
